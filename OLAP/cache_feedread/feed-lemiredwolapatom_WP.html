<div class='storycontent'> I wrote earlier that IBM announced it would no longer sell its DB2 OLAP Server. It looks like the move by IBM might mean that they plan to focus on their own OLAP product: in fact it&#8217;s more to do with their current focus on their Cube Views product, which in his opinion is more likely to be IBM&#8217;s future OLAP direction. So DB2 Cube Views will be the main IBM OLAP product?</div>

<div class='storycontent'> According to COMPUTERWOCHE ONLINE,  IBM is killing its DB/2 Olap Server by breaking its deal with Hyperion. This somewhat surprising move brings questions as to what IBM will do in the Business Intelligence arena&#8230; partner with Oracle or Microsoft, or do do something else? Maybe get out of the OLAP business altogether?</div>

<div class='storycontent'> In What was Sun thinking? (CNET News.com), Charles Cooper  tells us that storage is now in high demand: What with some of the confusing&#8211;make that idiotic&#8211;federal regulations governing corporate behavior that have appeared the last couple years, there&#8217;s a near bottomless demand for big storage systems. After the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA, CEOs are so keen on covering their posteriors these days that there&#8217;s no such thing as too much documentation. Identity and management access is the hot ticket these days as every management team worth its salt wants to tout how tough it now is on compliance. Wow. Seems like it is going to be a nice era for data warehousing and OLAP, no?</div>

<div class='storycontent'> This is brilliant! ACM Queue  is publishing an interview with Tim Bray (of XML fame) done by Jim Gray (of data cube and database transactions fame). Tim now runs Web technologies for Sun Microsystems. Tim Bray basically says that RDF and Semantic Web are a no go but we knew that&#8217;s what he thought.  However, there are many cool quotes. Try to find the pattern in these:  My CEO, Tom Jenkins, agreed to turn me loose to work on it myself, and I spent six months basically doing nothing else and built the crawler and the interfaces. (&#8230;) I lost weeks and weeks and weeks of sleep, hacking and patching and kludging to keep this thing on the air under the pressure of the load. Lark was the first XML processor, implemented in Java. I wrote it myself. I used it also as a vehicle to learn Java. It shipped in January 1997 and actually got used by a bunch of people. (&#8230;) So, I let Lark go. It was fun to write and I think it was helpful, but it hasn&#039;t been maintained since 1998. Some of the people working in syndication were extremely upset about XML&#039;s strictness, saying, &quot;Well, you know, people just can&#039;t be expected to generate well-formed data.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes they can.&quot; I went looking around and found that there are some quite decent libraries capable of doing that for Java and Perl and Python, but there didn&#039;t seem to be one for C. So sitting on the beach in Australia I wrote this little library in C called Genx that generates XML efficiently and guarantees that it is well-formed and canonical. See the pattern? Tim Bray is a hacker with a degree in mathematics and computer science. [Tim doesn&#8217;t have a graduate degree.] And he changed the world. But his life was not always easy:  Microsoft really went insane. There was a major meltdown and a war, and I was temporarily fired as XML coeditor. There was an aggressive attempt to destroy my career over that. (Note that the interviewer, Jim Gray, works for Microsoft!)</div>

<div class='storycontent'> I started using Google Mail (GMail) last year because I want to be able to read my mail from everywhere, all the time. Google offered me 1000 MB of free storage and one of the greatest user interface for a mail client. Oh! Did I mention it has nearly perfect spam filtering, without any effort on my part? I wondered what would happen when I would reached 1000 MB of mail. For me, that&#8217;s about 2 years of incoming mail, maybe a bit less. Well, my account has now 2057 MB of storage. That&#8217;s about 3 years worth of storage. It seems like Google increases your limit as need arises.</div>

<div class='storycontent'> The Call for Papers for DaWaK 2005 (7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery) is available. The conference will be held in Denmark. The objective of the 7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2005) is to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss research issues and experience in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions. This year the conference will also focus on autonomic aspect of data warehousing and knowledge discovery. Moreover, the conference will be supplemented with invited talks, panel discussion and industrial papers.</div>

<div class='storycontent'> The CFP for the 5th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining is out. It will be held in  New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (IEEE ICDM &#8216;05) provides a premier forum for the dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences as well as original research results in data mining, spanning applications, algorithms, software and systems. The conference draws researchers and application developers from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases and data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems and high performance computing. By promoting high quality and novel research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, the conference seeks to continuously advance the state of the art in data mining. As an important part of the conference, the workshops program will focus on new research challenges and initiatives, and the tutorials program will cover emerging data mining technologies and the latest developments in data mining.</div>
