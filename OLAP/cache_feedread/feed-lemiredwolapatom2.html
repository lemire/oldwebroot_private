<p class='feedItemDescription'>	<p>Steven will be presenting our paper <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/APICS2005.html">Analyzing Large Collections of Electronic Text Using OLAP</a> at <a href="http://euler.acadiau.ca/~apics/">APICS 2005</a>. This work is based on an idea by <a href="http://v5o5jotqkgfu3btr91t7w5fhzedjaoaz8igl.unbsj.ca/~kaser/">Owen Kaser</a>:<strong> what happens if we apply multidimensional databases (OLAP) to literary research?</strong></p>	<p> Data Mining and Information Retrieval techniques are used routinely for literary research or processing text in general, but decision support techniques commonly used in the business world (sometimes called &#8220;Business Intelligence&#8221;) have not seen much use yet in text processing. The main difference between decision support systems and data mining is the fact that in decision support, <strong>the user remains in control</strong>, thus simple yet extremely efficient algorithms are favoured over sophisticated, but possibly expensive algorithms. <strong>Ideally, all decision support algorithms should be O(1) after accounting for precomputations.</strong> With infinite storage almost available now, decision support research is due for a technological and scientific boom.</p>	<blockquote><p>Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has various applications in the humanities and social sciences. The increasing size of many electronic text archives has the advantage of a more complete analysis but the disadvantage of taking longer to obtain results. On-Line Analytical Processing is a method used to store and quickly analyze multidimensional data. By storing text analysis information in an OLAP system, a user can obtain solutions to inquiries in a matter of seconds as opposed to minutes, hours, or even days. This analysis is user-driven allowing various users the freedom to pursue their own direction of research.</p></blockquote></p>

Anything that generates data is fair game.</p></blockquote></p>

<p class='feedItemDescription'>	<p>Our paper <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/IS2006.html">Attribute Value Reordering For Efficient Hybrid OLAP</a> was accepted by Information Sciences a few days ago. It should appear next year I imagine but I make the preprint available now. It is an extended version of an earlier paper presented at DOLAP. In this case, the journal version is considerably extended and well worth the read.</p>	<p>It shows a very mathematical approach to multidimensional databases (OLAP) linking some OLAP problems to graph theory (an equivalent to graph isomorphism is shown) and there are some probabilistic results there as well.</p>	<p>There are also other, less mathematical, novel results like the concept of the normalizaiton of a data cube which is quite distinct from the normalization of a relational database.</p>	<blockquote><p>The normalization of a data cube is the ordering of the attribute values. For large multidimensional arrays where dense and sparse chunks are stored differently, proper normalization can lead to improved storage efficiency. We show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal normalization even for 1&#215;3 chunks, although we find an exact algorithm for 1&#215;2 chunks. When dimensions are nearly statistically independent, we show that dimension-wise attribute frequency sorting is an optimal normalization and takes time O(d n log(n)) for data cubes of size n^d. When dimensions are not independent, we propose and evaluate a several heuristics. The hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) storage mechanism is already 19%-30% more efficient than ROLAP, but normalization can improve it further by 9%-13% for a total gain of 29%-44% over ROLAP</p></blockquote></p>

<p class='feedItemDescription'>	<p>Shane Butler <a href="http://sbutler.com/blog/2005/08/afl-tipper/">is building a learner to predict AFL game results</a>. I don&#8217;t know why, but this sounds like fun stuff!</p>	<blockquote><p>Its been a while since my I last wrote that I was thinking of building a learner to predict AFL game results. Obviously with the finals starting this week I&#8217;m a bit late in the season but oh well! I can still simulate the season using the data I&#8217;ve collected. I&#8217;ve developed a number of Perl screen scrapers to collect all the data nessasary, which so far includes things like the match fixtures, game results, player stats and people&#8217;s tips (yes, this will be a hyprid of both historical data and human input). I&#8217;m at the stage now of using SQL generate things like a Home Ground Advantage (HGA) parameter - I guess you might call this the ETL stage!!</p></blockquote>	<p>If he fails with his learner, he could turn this project into an OLAP project! That&#8217;d be cool!</p></p>

Submissions may cover novel approaches in data management, visions that present new viewpoints and challenges, or a description of the implementation or deployment of advanced database technology in an industrial or application setting. Furthermore, since new challenging applications appear on the horizon, papers that describe those with respect to their technical substance, their impact, and their importance and relate them to today&#8217;s database technology are also solicited.</p></blockquote></p>

<p class='feedItemDescription'>	<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html">Paul Graham says that transparency (and thus data recording) is the way out of corruption</a>:</p>	<blockquote><p>How do you break the connection between wealth and power? Demand transparency. Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an account of how decisions are made. Why aren&#8217;t all police interrogations videotaped? Why did 36% of Princeton&#8217;s class of 2007 come from prep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them? Why did the US really invade Iraq? Why don&#8217;t government officials disclose more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?</p></blockquote>	<p>This is very important. Being rich brings you security, but not a lot of power if you have to go through the same process as everyone else. A just society is an open society where we record everything.</p>	<p>Big Brother might actually be the ticket to a just society.</p></p>
