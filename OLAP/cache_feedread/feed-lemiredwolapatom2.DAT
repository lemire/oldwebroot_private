This work is based on an idea by <a href="http://v5o5jotqkgfu3btr91t7w5fhzedjaoaz8igl.unbsj.ca/~kaser/">Owen Kaser</a>:<strong> what happens if we apply multidimensional databases (OLAP) to literary research?</strong></p>	<p> Data Mining and Information Retrieval techniques are used routinely for literary research or processing text in general, but decision support techniques commonly used in the business world (sometimes called &#8220;Business Intelligence&#8221;) have not seen much use yet in text processing. The main difference between decision support systems and data mining is the fact that in decision support, <strong>the user remains in control</strong>, thus simple yet extremely efficient algorithms are favoured over sophisticated, but possibly expensive algorithms. <strong>Ideally, all decision support algorithms should be O(1) after accounting for precomputations.</strong> With infinite storage almost available now, decision support research is due for a technological and scientific boom.</p>	<blockquote><p>Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has various applications in the humanities and social sciences. The increasing size of many electronic text archives has the advantage of a more complete analysis but the disadvantage of taking longer to obtain results. On-Line Analytical Processing is a method used to store and quickly analyze multidimensional data. By storing text analysis information in an OLAP system, a user can obtain solutions to inquiries in a matter of seconds as opposed to minutes, hours, or even days. This analysis is user-driven allowing various users the freedom to pursue their own direction of research.</p></blockquote>";}}i:1;a:9:{s:6:"author";s:13:"Daniel Lemire";s:5:"title";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:44:"2005 QlikView Think Outside The Cube Contest";}s:4:"link";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:99:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/09/29/2005-qlikview-think-outside-the-cube-contest/";}s:2:"id";s:99:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/09/29/2005-qlikview-think-outside-the-cube-contest/";s:8:"modified";s:20:"2005-09-29T13:46:26Z";s:6:"issued";s:20:"2005-09-29T13:46:26Z";s:10:"dc:subject";s:25:"Data Warehousing and OLAP";s:7:"summary";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:10:"text/plain";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:366:"	If you are into Business Intelligence, this might interest you: the 2005 QlikView Think Outside The Cube Contest is open.

In this case, the journal version is considerably extended and well worth the read.</p>	<p>It shows a very mathematical approach to multidimensional databases (OLAP) linking some OLAP problems to graph theory (an equivalent to graph isomorphism is shown) and there are some probabilistic results there as well.</p>	<p>There are also other, less mathematical, novel results like the concept of the normalizaiton of a data cube which is quite distinct from the normalization of a relational database.</p>	<blockquote><p>The normalization of a data cube is the ordering of the attribute values. For large multidimensional arrays where dense and sparse chunks are stored differently, proper normalization can lead to improved storage efficiency. We show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal normalization even for 1&#215;3 chunks, although we find an exact algorithm for 1&#215;2 chunks. When dimensions are nearly statistically independent, we show that dimension-wise attribute frequency sorting is an optimal normalization and takes time O(d n log(n)) for data cubes of size n^d. When dimensions are not independent, we propose and evaluate a several heuristics. The hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) storage mechanism is already 19%-30% more efficient than ROLAP, but normalization can improve it further by 9%-13% for a total gain of 29%-44% over ROLAP</p></blockquote>";}}i:5;a:9:{s:6:"author";s:13:"Daniel Lemire";s:5:"title";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:28:"Now, that&#8217;s fun stuff!";}s:4:"link";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:74:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/09/06/now-thats-fun-stuff/";}s:2:"id";s:74:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/09/06/now-thats-fun-stuff/";s:8:"modified";s:20:"2005-09-07T03:01:57Z";s:6:"issued";s:20:"2005-09-07T03:01:57Z";s:10:"dc:subject";s:25:"Data Warehousing and OLAP";s:7:"summary";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:10:"text/plain";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:309:"	Shane Butler is building a learner to predict AFL game results.

Why don&#8217;t government officials disclose more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?</p></blockquote>	<p>This is very important. Being rich brings you security, but not a lot of power if you have to go through the same process as everyone else.

(&#8230;) I lost weeks and weeks and weeks of sleep, hacking and patching and kludging to keep this thing on the air under the pressure of the load.</p></blockquote>	<blockquote><p>Lark was the first XML processor, implemented in Java. I wrote it myself. I used it also as a vehicle to learn Java. It shipped in January 1997 and actually got used by a bunch of people. (&#8230;) So, I let Lark go. It was fun to write and I think it was helpful, but it hasn’t been maintained since 1998.</p></blockquote>	<blockquote><p>Some of the people working in syndication were extremely upset about XML’s strictness, saying, “Well, you know, people just can’t be expected to generate well-formed data.” And I said, “Yes they can.” I went looking around and found that there are some quite decent libraries capable of doing that for Java and Perl and Python, but there didn’t seem to be one for C.</p>	<p>So sitting on the beach in Australia I wrote this little library in C called Genx that generates XML efficiently and guarantees that it is well-formed and canonical.</p></blockquote>	<p>See the pattern? Tim Bray is a hacker with a degree in mathematics and computer science. [<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/04/14/Doctor-Sass">Tim doesn&#8217;t have a graduate degree.</a>] And he changed the world.</p>	<p>But his life was not always easy:</p>	<blockquote><p> Microsoft really went insane. There was a major meltdown and a war, and I was temporarily fired as XML coeditor.

To give you an idea, Yvan published 400 papers, he has 4 full-time contract employees, two post-doctoral fellows and something like 15 graduate students in his lab. He has for $750k in software alone in his laboratory. He must be one of the top researcher in &#8220;spatial OLAP&#8221; (which he calls SOLAP) in the world. He works at the geomatics department in Laval University. It is one of 3 geomatics departments in Canada. (While I don&#8217;t have a definition of geomatics&#8230; it is all about mapping and measuring distances,  and so on.)</p>	<p>Some of his projects include decision-support tools for trainers who work with top athletes: through fine-resolution GPS, you can track the an athlete, collect all this data, pour it into data cubes and make various comparison, see where, on the track, the athlete is improving, where he is not improving, and so on. He also built a tool to mine road conditions and help set repair priorities.</p>	<p>We discussed various research issues such as the fact that rebuilding the cubes is expensive in a spatial-temporal context, and how view maintenance appears to be lacking from current commercial tools like SQL Server (I&#8217;ll need to investigate this particular issue). He has committed to achieving  real-time data cubes in 5 years (which implies continuous updates) for his current portfolio of applications.</p>	<p>The use some already available classical multidimensional indexing techniques such as R-trees and R+-trees. However, they are fairly dependent on currently available commercial (and open source) tools as they focus mostly on the application layer and specifically on the geometry and topology of the data.</p>	<p>I&#8217;m very impressed.</p>	<p>Myself, I presented some of the work I do with <a href="http://v5o5jotqkgfu3btr91t7w5fhzedjaoaz8igl.unbsj.ca/~kaser/">Owen Kaser</a> as part of the Lemur project, including <a href="http://www.ondelette.com/lemire/abstracts/DOLAP2003.html">Attribute-Value Reordering</a> and <a href="http://www.ondelette.com/lemire/abstracts/CASCON2002.html">Relative Prefix Sum Methods</a>. I got people laughing, so either they thought I was ridiculous or else, they enjoyed my style. There were many questions and people seemed to be interested, so maybe they thought it wasn&#8217;t silly work after all.</p>";}}i:27;a:9:{s:6:"author";s:13:"Daniel Lemire";s:5:"title";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:45:"Lemire speaks at the CRG (February 11th 2005)";}s:4:"link";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:98:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/02/03/lemire-speaks-at-the-crg-february-11th-2005/";}s:2:"id";s:98:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/02/03/lemire-speaks-at-the-crg-february-11th-2005/";s:8:"modified";s:20:"2005-02-03T21:05:22Z";s:6:"issued";s:20:"2005-02-03T21:05:22Z";s:10:"dc:subject";a:2:{i:0;s:25:"Data Warehousing and OLAP";i:1;s:11:"Past Events";}s:7:"summary";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:10:"text/plain";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:426:"	I&#8217;ve been invited to speak at the Centre de recherche en géomatique on my work on OLAP.

Or, il existe depuis plusieurs années des solutions pour produire ce type d’information pour les données non-spatiales. Ces dernières reposent sur les bases de données dites « multidimensionnelle » et elles sont à la base de l’informatique décisionnelle (ex. data warehousing, datamart, OLAP, data mining). Toutefois, ces solutions sont inefficaces pour les données géospatiales et ne permettent pas d’en tirer tout leur potentiel. Le but de cette conférence est de présenter un programme de recherche qui vise à offrir des solutions théoriques, méthodologiques et technologiques facilitant la mise en place de bases de données géospatiales décisionnelles, soit le programme de recherche de la nouvelle chaire industrielle CRSNG en bases de données géospatiales décisionnelles.</p>	<p>2) Daniel Lemire, Ph.D.</p>	<p>Titre de l&#8217;exposé : Accélération des bases de données multidimensionnelles par ondelettes et tri des valeurs d&#8217;attribut</p>	<p>Résumé : Les bases de données multidimensionnelles (OLAP) sont maintenant omniprésentes dans l&#8217;industrie représentant un marché mondial de plus de 4 milliars de dollars américains. Au sein du groupe Lemur, nous nous intéressons plus particulièrement aux problèmes de performance et de mise à l&#8217;échelle. D&#8217;une part, nous nous intéressons à l&#8217;accélération des requêtes sur plage par l&#8217;utilisation de méthodes hiérarchiques inspirées des ondelettes obliques. D&#8217;autre part, nous nous intéressons au tri des valeurs d&#8217;attribut dans les modèles hybride (HOLAP) comme méthode pour compresser les données tout en accélérant les requêtes.</p>	<p>Entrée libre<br />Un 5 à 7 suivra les conférences<br />au local 1306 du pavillon Louis-Jacques-Casault</p></blockquote>";}}i:28;a:9:{s:6:"author";s:13:"Daniel Lemire";s:5:"title";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:51:"DAWAK&#8217;05 (April 15, 2005 / August 22-26 2005)";}s:4:"link";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:94:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/01/14/dawak05-april-15-2005-august-22-26-2005/";}s:2:"id";s:94:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/01/14/dawak05-april-15-2005-august-22-26-2005/";s:8:"modified";s:20:"2005-01-14T15:07:49Z";s:6:"issued";s:20:"2005-01-14T15:07:49Z";s:10:"dc:subject";a:2:{i:0;s:25:"Data Warehousing and OLAP";i:1;s:11:"Past Events";}s:7:"summary";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:2:{s:4:"type";s:10:"text/plain";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:439:"	The call for paper for DAWAK&#8217;05 is out.7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery(DaWaK 2005)22 - 26 August 2005Copenhagen, Denmarkhttp://www.dexa.org/	The objective of the 7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2005) is to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss research issues and experience in developing and deploying data [...]";}s:7:"content";a:2:{s:5:"_ATTR";a:3:{s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"mode";s:7:"escaped";s:8:"xml:base";s:94:"http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/01/14/dawak05-april-15-2005-august-22-26-2005/";}s:6:"_VALUE";s:843:"	<p><a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dawak2005/">The call for paper for DAWAK&#8217;05 is out.</a></p>	<blockquote><p>7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery<br />(DaWaK 2005)<br />22 - 26 August 2005<br />Copenhagen, Denmark<br />http://www.dexa.org/</p>	<p>The objective of the 7th International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK 2005) is to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners to discuss research issues and experience in developing and deploying data warehousing and knowledge discovery systems, applications, and solutions.
