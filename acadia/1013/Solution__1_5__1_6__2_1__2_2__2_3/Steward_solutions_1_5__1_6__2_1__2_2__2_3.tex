and Models}}

\setcounter{subsection}{4}


\subsection{\noindent \texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblue}{Exponential Functions}}{Exponential Functions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{14}] 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We say that two functions \( f \) and \( g \) are reflected about
a line \( y=a \) if \( f(x)-a \) and \( g(x)-a \) are equal but
have opposite signs for all \( x \). Therefore, in the present case,
we need to find a function \( f(x) \) such that \( f(x)-4=4-e^{x} \)
and that's \( f(x)=8-e^{x} \) (see Fig. \ref{refy4}).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_5_14} \par}


\caption{\label{refy4}Reflection about the line \protect\( y=4\protect \)}
\end{figure}

\item Two functions \( f \) and \( g \) are reflected about the line \( x=a \)
if \( f(a+x)=g(a-x) \) for all \( x \). The function we are looking
for is \( f(x+2)=e^{2-x} \) because \( g(x)=e^{x} \). We finally
substitute \( z=x+2 \) (or \( x=z-2 \)) to obtain \( f(z)=e^{4-z} \)
(see Fig. \ref{refy4b}).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_5_14b} \par}


\caption{\label{refy4b}Reflection about the line \protect\( x=2\protect \)}
\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{16}]\label{enum:question16}Looking at the graph, we can
observe that \( f(0)=2 \) and \( f(2)=\frac{2}{9} \). Since \( f(x)=Ca^{x} \),
we have that\begin{equation}
\label{eqntrivial}
Ca^{0}=2
\end{equation}
and\begin{equation}
\label{eqnnotsotrivial}
Ca^{2}=\frac{2}{9}.
\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eqntrivial}, we see right away that \( C=2 \)
and therefore, equation \ref{eqnnotsotrivial} becomes\[
a^{2}=\frac{1}{9}\]
which implies that \( a=\pm \frac{1}{3} \). However, we must reject
the solution \( a=-\frac{1}{3} \) because the function \( f(x)=2\times \left( \frac{-1}{3}\right) ^{x} \)
implies \( f(1)=\frac{-2}{3} \) which doesn't agree with the graph.
We have one remaining solution and it is \[
f(x)=2\times \left( \frac{1}{3}\right) ^{x}.\]

\item [\setenumi{18}]We will assume that the highest paying job at the end
of the month must be chosen. The first job pays \( 1,000,000 \) over
a month. How much pays the second one? Setting up the equation is
not very difficult, we readily see that it pays%
\footnote{We chose a month with 30 days.
} \begin{equation}
\label{geom}
pay=\sum _{n=1}^{30}2^{n-1}.
\end{equation}
How much is it? The formula \ref{geom} is called a \textit{geometric
series}. We can solve it rather easily, we simply evaluate \( pay-2\times pay \)
by using formula \ref{geom} which gives\begin{eqnarray*}
pay-2\times pay= & \sum _{n=1}^{30}2^{n-1}-2\times \sum _{n=1}^{30}2^{n-1} & \\
= & \sum _{n=1}^{30}2^{n-1}-\sum _{n=2}^{31}2^{n-1} & \\
= & 2^{0}-2^{30} & 
\end{eqnarray*}
We then solve for \( pay \) in \( pay-2\times pay=1-2^{30} \) which
is very easy since \( pay-2\times pay=-pay \), and we finally have
\( pay=2^{30}-1 \). It should be noted here that \( 2^{30} \) is
a very big number (about one billion or \( 1,073,741,824 \)).
What is the lesson here? Exponential functions can increase \textbf{\textcolor{red}{very
fast}}%
\footnote{Most modern computer architectures are 32 bits (Windows, Linux and
even the new gaming consoles). Therefore, the highest integer value
most programmers will ever expect is \( 2^{32}-1 \). Of course, newer
computer architectures will probably be 64 bits and integers will
go up to \( 2^{64}-1 \). Will that be a big improvement? How much
bigger is \( 2^{64} \) with respect to \( 2^{32} \)?
}. 
\item [\setenumi{24}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given that the half-life is 15 hours, after 15 hours, we have \( 2/2=1 \)
g left (by definition). After another 15 hours (for a total of 30
hours), we have \( 1/2 \) g left, and after yet another 15 hours
(for a total of 30 hours), we have \( 1/4 \) g left. Finally, after
60 hours, we'll have \( 1/8 \) g left%
\footnote{It is also possible to deduce this result from equation \ref{decayofsodium}.
}.
\item Since the decay is exponential, we have that \begin{equation}
\label{expbasic}
m(x)=Ca^{x}.
\end{equation}
 First of all, \( m(0)=2 \) and therefore \( C=2 \) (see equation
\ref{eqntrivial} \vpageref{eqntrivial}). We have that after 15 hours,
the mass must be half, so \begin{equation}
\label{halflife}
m(15)=1.
\end{equation}
Combining equations \ref{expbasic} and \ref{halflife}, we get that\begin{equation}
\label{a15}
2a^{15}=1
\end{equation}
 \( 2a^{15}=1 \) and we must now solve for \( a \). One way to do
it (assuming we don't know about logarithms) is to take the equation
\ref{a15}to the power \( \frac{1}{15} \) to get \[
a=\frac{1}{2^{1/15}}\cong \frac{1}{1.047}\cong 0.9548.\]
 This means that the mass of our sample goes down according to the
equation%
\footnote{Actually, your calculator or mathematical software is likely to evaluate
this function using the formula \( e^{(1-x/15)\ln 2} \) instead.
We will come back to logarithms and their applications later in the
course. 
} \begin{equation}
\label{decayofsodium}
m(x)=2\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) ^{\frac{x}{15}}=\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) ^{\frac{x}{15}-1}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_5_24} \par}


\caption{Mass of sodium vs time according to equation \ref{decayofsodium}}
\end{figure}

\item Amount after 4 days? What you \textcolor{red}{must not} do here is
substitute \( 4 \) in equation \ref{decayofsodium}. The correct
reasoning is to first convert 4 days in hours. We have 24 hours for
every day, so 4 days is \( 4\times 24=96 \) hours. Therefore, the
remaining mass will be\[
m(96)=\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) ^{\frac{96}{15}-1}\cong 0.02.\]

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblue}{Inverse Functions and Logarithms}}{Inverse Functions and Logarithms}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{18}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have to solve the equation \[
3=3+x^{2}+\tan (\pi x/2)\]
which simplifies to \[
\tan (\pi x/2)=-x^{2}.\]
Now, some of you might think that life is pretty hard (and it sometimes
is!). But wait! What is \( \tan (0) \)? \( 0 \) of course! And what
is \( x^{2} \) evaluated at \( 0 \)? \( 0 \) of course! So we found
a solution which we will assume to be unique and we conclude that
\( f^{-1}(3)=0 \) (See Fig. \ref{equation1to1maybe}).
\item \textcolor{red}{You must not try to evaluate \( f^{-1}(5) \)!} We
write \( x_{5}=f^{-1}(5) \) and \( x_{5} \) is defined by the equation
\( f\left( x_{5}\right) =5 \). And thus \[
f\left( f^{-1}\left( 5\right) \right) =f\left( x_{5}\right) =5.\]

\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_6_18} \par}


\caption{\label{equation1to1maybe}\protect\( 3+x^{2}+\tan (\pi x/2)\protect \)}
\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{28}]We want to compute the inverse of the following function\begin{equation}
\label{1expover1moinsx}
f(x)=\left( 1+e^{x}\right) /\left( 1-e^{x}\right) 
\end{equation}
 It is worth noting that when \( x=0 \), we get \( f(0)=2/0=\infty  \).
Since we know that \( \ln \left( e^{x}\right) =x \), we have \begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1+e^{x}}{1-e^{x}}=y & \Longrightarrow  & \left( 1-e^{x}\right) y=1+e^{x}\\
 & \Longrightarrow  & (1+y)e^{x}=y-1\\
 & \Longrightarrow  & e^{x}=\frac{y-1}{y+1}\\
 & \Longrightarrow  & x=\ln \left( \frac{y-1}{y+1}\right) .
\end{eqnarray*}
Of course, this function isn't defined for \( \frac{y-1}{y+1}\leq 0 \)
or \( -1\leq y\leq 1 \). One could verify that \( f(x) \) in equation
\ref{1expover1moinsx} never takes these values (see also Fig. \ref{graph1exp}). 
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_6_28} \par}


\caption{\label{graph1exp}\protect\( f(x)=\left( 1+e^{x}\right) /\left( 1-e^{x}\right) \protect \)}
\end{figure}
 
\item [\setenumi{36}]Recall that \( \log a^{b}=b\log a \) and \( \log _{a}a=1 \).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \( \log _{8}2=\log _{8}\left( 8^{\frac{1}{3}}\right) =\frac{1}{3}\times \log _{8}8 \)
because \( \log a^{b}=b\log a \), and since \( \log _{a}a=1 \),
\[
\frac{1}{3}\times \log _{8}8=\frac{1}{3}\]
 so that \( \log _{8}2=\frac{1}{3} \).
\item \( \ln e^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}\ln e \) because \( \ln a^{b}=b\ln a \),
and since \( \ln e=1 \), we have \( \ln e^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt[]{2} \). 
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{38}]Recall that \( a^{b+c}=a^{b}a^{c} \) and \( a^{\log _{a}b}=b \)
(see equation 7 in \cite{Steward} on page 68).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \( 2^{\log _{2}3+\log _{2}5}=2^{\log _{2}3}\times 2^{\log _{2}5}=3\times 5=15 \)
\item \( e^{3\ln 2}=e^{\ln \left( 2^{3}\right) }=2^{3}=8 \)
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{42}]The logarithm has \( \left( 0,\infty \right)  \) for
its domain (it isn't defined elsewhere, at least in this course).
Therefore, in \( \ln \left( 4-x^{2}\right)  \), we need to have \( 4-x^{2}\geq 0 \)
or\begin{equation}
\label{sqrt4}
x^{2}<4.
\end{equation}
 At this point, one must be \textcolor{red}{careful}. We may think
of taking the square root on both sides of equation \ref{sqrt4} (getting
\( x<2 \)) and indeed, it is correct to do so... as long as you realize
that if \( a^{2}=b \) then so does \( \left( -a\right) ^{2}=b \)!
That is, you have to consider negative values as well... Therefore,
we have \[
x<2\]
 \textcolor{blue}{and} \[
x>-2.\]
We conclude that the domain of \( \ln \left( 4-x^{2}\right)  \) is
\( \left( -2,2\right)  \).\\
As for the range of the function... we first have to look at the range
of \( 4-x^{2} \) over \( \left( -2,2\right)  \). Clearly, the polynomial
is at its maximum when \( x=0 \) and so its range has \( 4 \) as
an upper bound. On the other hand, it has \( 0 \) as its lower bound
and therefore the range of \( 4-x^{2} \) over \( \left( -2,2\right)  \)
is \( \left( 0,4\right]  \). Since the logarithm is a strictly increasing
function, we can conclude that the range of \( \ln \left( 4-x^{2}\right)  \)
is \( \left( \ln 0,\ln 4\right]  \) or \( \left( -\infty ,\ln 4\right]  \)
or approximately \( \left( -\infty ,1.386\right]  \) (see Fig. \ref{graphln4}).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question1_6_42} \par}


\caption{\label{graphln4}\protect\( f(x)=\left( 1+e^{x}\right) /\left( 1-e^{x}\right) \protect \)}
\end{figure}
 
\item [\setenumi{52}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Starting from \( \ln \ln x=1 \), we write \( e^{1}=e^{\ln \ln x} \)
but since \( e^{\ln w}=w \), we have \( e=\ln x \) and finally,
we write \[
e^{e}=e^{\ln x}=x\]
so that \( x=e^{e} \).
\item Starting from \( e^{ax}=Ce^{bx} \), we divide both sides of the equation
by \( e^{bx} \) (which we know to be a non-zero positive number!
why?) to get \[
e^{\left( a-b\right) x}=C.\]
 We can then simply take the logarithm of both sides of the equation
to get\[
\left( a-b\right) x=\ln C\]
and therefore \( x=\frac{\ln C}{a-b} \) because \( a\neq b \).
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{58}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have to solve for \( t \) in \[
Q_{0}\left( 1-e^{-t/a}\right) =Q.\]
 We begin by dividing by \( Q_{0} \) both sides of the equation and
after some algebra, we get\[
e^{-t/a}=1-\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}.\]
Taking the logarithm, we get\[
\frac{-t}{a}=\ln \left( 1-\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) \]
or\[
t=-a\ln \left( 1-\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) \]
or\begin{equation}
\label{timefunctionQ}
t=a\ln \frac{Q_{0}}{Q_{0}-Q}
\end{equation}
because \( \ln c/b=-\ln b/c \). It should be noted that if \( Q_{0}=Q \)
(at time \( t=0 \)), then we have the logarithm of \( 0 \) or of
\( \infty  \) which is not very good! We must therefore require that
\( Q<Q_{0} \) in which case \[
\frac{Q_{0}}{Q_{0}-Q}>1\]
 and therefore \( t>0 \) (because \( \ln \left( 1\right) =0 \)).
When \( Q=0 \), we have \( t=0 \). What does equation \ref{timefunctionQ}
mean? Well, it gives us time as a function of the charge \( Q \).
When the charge is at its minimum (\( 0 \)), then \( t=0 \) and
we know that we just started recharging... as \( Q \) increases (getting
closer to \( Q_{0} \)), we can compute the corresponding number of
seconds we waited. 
\item Setting \( Q=0.9Q_{0} \) and substituting in equation \ref{timefunctionQ},
we have \begin{eqnarray*}
t & = & a\ln \frac{Q_{0}}{Q_{0}-0.9Q_{0}}\\
 & = & a\ln \frac{Q_{0}}{0.1Q_{0}}\\
 & = & a\ln \frac{1}{0.1}\\
 & = & a\ln 10
\end{eqnarray*}
and because \( a=2 \), we have \( t=2\ln 10\cong 4.6 \) seconds.
Bonus: how long for 99\% of the charge? We substitute again to get
\( t=2\ln \frac{1}{0.01}\cong 9.2 \) seconds... how long for 99.9\%
of the charge? We have \( t=2\ln \frac{1}{0.001}\cong 13.8 \) seconds...
What is happening? The logarithm grows very slowly! We can get very,
very close to full charge without waiting all that long! 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblackblue}{Limits and Derivatives}}{Limits and Derivatives}}


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblue}{The Tangent and Velocity Problems}}{The Tangent and Velocity Problems}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{2}]It is always useful to begin by plotting the points
we are given. You can do it very easily using Maple%
\footnote{Many different plotting tools can be used including Mathematica, gnuplot,
Matlab, Mathcad, EasyCalc (for Palm Pilot or Visor users). While you'll
learn to use Maple in this course, you can use any tool that suits
your needs. Some of them are free (gnuplot and EasyCalc for example).
} (see Fig. \ref{graphheart}).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question2_1_2} \par}


\caption{\label{graphheart}Heartbeats vs minutes}
\end{figure}
 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We want to compute the slope of the secant line passing through \( \left( 36,2530\right)  \)
and \( \left( 42,2948\right)  \). Recall that the slope of the line
passing through \( \left( x_{1},y_{1}\right)  \) and \( \left( x_{1},y_{1}\right)  \)
is given my \[
m=\frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}.\]
In the present case, we therefore have \[
m=\frac{2530-2948}{36-42}\cong 69.7.\]

\item We have to compute the slope of the secant line passing through \( \left( 38,2661\right)  \)
and \( \left( 42,2948\right)  \) which is\[
m=\frac{2661-2948}{38-42}=71.75.\]

\item We have to compute the slope of the secant line passing through \( \left( 40,2806\right)  \)
and \( \left( 42,2948\right)  \) which is\[
m=\frac{2806-2948}{40-42}=71.\]

\item We have to compute the slope of the secant line passing through \( \left( 42,2948\right)  \)
and \( \left( 44,3080\right)  \) which is\[
m=\frac{2948-3080}{42-44}=66.\]
 If we want to approximate the slope of the tangent line at \( 42 \),
we can look at the two closest secant lines (c and d) and expect the
slope of the tangent line to be somewhere between \( 66 \) and \( 71 \).
We can use the average of the two values \( \frac{66+71}{2}\cong 68.5 \)
as a good estimation for the heart rate in beats per minute at time
\( t=72 \).
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{4}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have have to compute the slope of the line passing through \( \left( 2,\ln 2\right)  \)
and \( \left( x,\ln x\right)  \) for some values of \( x \). The
general formula for the slope is going to be\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln x}{2-x}.\]
Note that while the question in Steward require 6 decimal places values
for the slope, we give only 3 decimal places below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For \( x=1.5 \), we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 1.5}{2-1.5}\cong 0.575.\]

\item For \( x=0.9, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 0.9}{2-0.9}\cong 0.726.\]

\item For \( x=1.99, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 1.99}{2-1.99}\cong 0.501.\]

\item For \( x=1.999, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 1.999}{2-1.999}\cong 0.5.\]

\item For \( x=2.5, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 2.5}{2-2.5}\cong 0.446.\]

\item For \( x=2.1, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 2.1}{2-2.1}\cong 0.488.\]

\item For \( x=2.01, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 2.01}{2-2.01}\cong 0.499.\]

\item For \( x=2.001, \) we have\[
m=\frac{\ln 2-\ln 1.5}{2-1.5}\cong 0.5.\]

\end{enumerate}
\item To guess the value of the slope, we look at the secant lines we get
with \( x=1.999 \) and \( x=2.001 \), they both have a slope of
\( \approx 0.5 \) and therefore, \( m=0.5 \) is our best guess.
\item The tangent line will have a slope of \( 0.5 \) and therefore, its
equation is going to be\begin{equation}
\label{linehalf}
y=0.5x+b
\end{equation}
 and it remains to solve for \( b \). We know that the tangent line
must pass through \( \left( 2,\ln 2\right)  \) and so we substitute
these values in equation \ref{linehalf}. Solving for \( b \), we
get\[
b=\ln 2-0.5\times 2=\ln 2-1\cong -0.306.\]
We therefore have the equation \[
y=0.5x-\ln 2+1.\]

\item Before sketching, we may compute the actual equations for the second
lines. Choosing \( x=1.5 \) and \( x=2.5 \) from part a, we have
to solve for \( b \) in the following equations\[
0.575\times 2+b=\ln 2\]
and\[
0.446\times 2+b=\ln 2.\]
It is, of course, very easy. We get \( b\cong -0.457 \) and \( b\cong -0.198 \)
respectively. For sketch, see Fig. \ref{graphtangents}

for the curve \protect\( y=\ln x\protect \).}
\end{figure}
 
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{6}]We plot the height as a function in time (see Fig. \ref{graphgalileo}).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Computing the average velocity is very similar to computing the slope
of a secant line as we shall see.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The average velocity is given by\[
\frac{\left( 58\times 1-0.83\times 1^{2}\right) -\left( 58\times 2-0.83\times 2^{2}\right) }{1-2}=55.51.\]

\item The average velocity is given by\[
\frac{\left( 58\times 1-0.83\times 1^{2}\right) -\left( 58\times 1.5-0.83\times 1.5^{2}\right) }{1-1.5}=55.925.\]

\item The average velocity is given by\[
\frac{\left( 58\times 1-0.83\times 1^{2}\right) -\left( 58\times 1.1-0.83\times 1.1^{2}\right) }{1-1.1}=56.257.\]

\item The average velocity is given by\[
\frac{\left( 58\times 1-0.83\times 1^{2}\right) -\left( 58\times 2-0.83\times 1.01^{2}\right) }{1-1.01}=56.3317.\]

\item The average velocity is given by\[
\frac{\left( 58\times 1-0.83\times 1^{2}\right) -\left( 58\times 1.001-0.83\times 1.001^{2}\right) }{1-1.001}=56.33917.\]

\end{enumerate}
\item We can estimate from the previous results that the velocity at \( t=1 \)
is going to be \( 56.34 \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblue}{The Limit of a Function}}{The Limit of a Function}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{4}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We have a continuous function at \( x=0 \) and the limit from both
sides will tend to \( 3 \).
\item If we come from the left, the limit will tend to \( 4 \) even though
it might not agree with the limit from the right or the value of the
function at \( x=3 \).
\item This time, the limit tends to \( 2 \) even though it doesn't agree
with the limit from the left and the value of the function at \( x=3 \).
\item From our previous comments, the limits from the left and from the
right don't agree so that the limit doesn't exist (see \cite[section 2.2, equation 3]{Steward})
\item Even though, it might seem strange, the value of \( f(3) \) is simply
\( 3 \).
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{6}]We sketch the graph of the function \( f \) using our
favorite software package (in this case, we are using gnuplot, see
Fig. \ref{graphdiscontinuous}). For the graph, it is clear that \( \lim _{x\rightarrow -1}f(x) \)
and \( \lim _{x\rightarrow 1}f(x) \) do not exist. Other than than,
all limits will exist so that the set we are looking for is \( \mathds {R}-\{-1,1\} \).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question2_2_6} \par}


\caption{\label{graphdiscontinuous}The discontinuous function \protect\( f(x)\protect \).}
\end{figure}
 
\item [\setenumi{16}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We plot\( \frac{6^{x}-2^{x}}{x} \) near \( x=0 \) using our favorite
plotting software (see Fig. \ref{graphexp62}). Clearly we have that
the limit must be closed to \( 1.10 \).
\begin{figure}
[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{question2_2_16} \par}


\caption{\label{graphexp62}The function \protect\( \frac{6^{x}-2^{x}}{x}\protect \)
near \protect\( x=0\protect \).}
\end{figure}

\item Evaluating \( \frac{6^{x}-2^{x}}{x} \) at \( x=0.0001 \), we get
\( \approx 1.098 \) and at \( x=-0.0001 \), we get \( \approx 1.098 \)
and therefore \( 1.10 \) is clearly a good choice.
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{18}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item We use our calculator to get\[
\frac{\tan 1-1}{1^{3}}\cong 0.5574,\]
\[
\frac{\tan 0.5-0.5}{0.5^{3}}\cong 0.3704,\]
\[
\frac{\tan 0.1-0.1}{0.1^{3}}\cong 0.3347,\]
\[
\frac{\tan 0.05-0.05}{0.05^{3}}\cong 0.3337,\]
\[
\frac{\tan 0.01-0.01}{0.01^{3}}\cong 0.3333,\]
\[
\frac{\tan 0.005-0.005}{0.005^{3}}\cong 0.3333.\]

\item Since values tend to go to \( 1/3 \) when \( x \) goes down to \( 0 \),
we must assume that the limit will tend to \( 0 \).
\item Using a calculator, we get \( 0 \) for values around \( 1\times 10^{-8} \)%
\footnote{Smarter calculators may still print a non-zero value, but no matter
what, you'll eventually get small enough values for your calculator
to print \( 0 \). Just try smaller values for \( x \).
}. Looking closely at the problem, we see that \( \tan x-x \) has
value \( 0 \) on the calculator for \( x=1\times 10^{-8} \), whereas
\( x^{3}=1\times 10^{-24} \). Why do we get \( \tan x-x=0 \) instead
of \( \sim x^{3}/3\cong 3\times 10^{-25} \)? First of all, what is
\( \tan x \) when \( x=1\times 10^{-8} \)? Simply \( 1\times 10^{-8} \),
of course, which explain why we get \( \tan x-x=0 \) in the first
place! We might expect \( \tan x=1\times 10^{-8}+3\times 10^{-25} \)
instead... but wait! Can your calculator manage a number like \( 1\times 10^{-8}+3\times 10^{-25} \).
Of course not! For most calculator, \( 3\times 10^{-25} \) is just
too small with respect to \( 1\times 10^{-8} \) and it will just
be discarded. Therefore, we are still confident about the value of
our limit being \( 1/3 \) and that the zero values come from numerical
error.
\item We use our favorite plotting package... See Fig. \ref{graphlimittan}
and \ref{graphlimittanstress}. We can see on Fig. \ref{graphlimittanstress}
how the graphing tool has problems with values very close to \( 0 \)
since the curve doesn't seem to be as smooth as one would expect and
it eventually goes to \( 0 \). Notice that scientists often get around
these problems by changing the units they are using.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textcolor{webblue}{Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws}}{Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{6}]We have that\begin{eqnarray}
\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}\sqrt{u^{4}+3u+6} & = & \sqrt{\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}u^{4}+3u+6}\label{deleteme} \\
 & = & \sqrt{\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}u^{4}+\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}3u+\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}6}\label{deleteme2} \\
 & = & \sqrt{\left( \lim _{u\rightarrow -2}u\right) ^{4}+3\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}u+\lim _{u\rightarrow -2}6}\label{deleteme3} \\
 & = & \sqrt{\left( -2\right) ^{4}+3\times -2+6}\label{deleteme4} \\
 & = & \sqrt{16}=4
\end{eqnarray}
by using respectively the Root Law (equation \ref{deleteme}), Law
1 (equation \ref{deleteme2}), the Power Law and Law 3 (equation \ref{deleteme3})
and Laws 7 and 8 (equation \ref{deleteme4}).
\item [\setenumi{8}]

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is not true when \( x=2 \) because the right hand side isn't defined
(division by 0).
\item The limit of a function at \( x=2 \) doesn't depend on the value
of the function at \( x=2 \) itself, but only on the values nearby.
Since the equality presented in question a is true everywhere but
at \( x=2 \), this new equation is correct.
\end{enumerate}
\item [\setenumi{10}]We have that \( \lim _{x\rightarrow -4}x^{2}+3x-4=0 \)
and therefore, we cannot use the quotient rule. Notice however that
\[
\frac{x^{2}+5x+4}{x^{2}+3x-4}=\frac{\left( x+4\right) \left( x+1\right) }{\left( x+4\right) \left( x-1\right) }\]
and so, for \( x\neq -4 \), we can consider\begin{equation}
\label{xmoinsxplus}
f(x)=\frac{\left( x+1\right) }{\left( x-1\right) }
\end{equation}
instead. Now, it is much easier because we can use the quotient rule.\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}\frac{\left( x+1\right) }{\left( x-1\right) } & = & \frac{\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}\left( x+1\right) }{\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}\left( x-1\right) }\\
 & = & \frac{\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}x+\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}1}{\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}x-\lim _{x\rightarrow -4}1}\\
 & = & \frac{-4+1}{-4-1}=\frac{3}{5}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\item [\setenumi{12}]We must first simplify the function for \( x\neq 1 \),\[
\frac{x^{3}-1}{x^{2}-1}=\frac{\left( x-1\right) \left( x^{2}+x+1\right) }{\left( x-1\right) \left( x+1\right) }=\frac{x^{2}+x+1}{x+1}\]
and now, we can use the Quotient Law,\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim _{x\rightarrow 1}\frac{x^{3}-1}{x^{2}-1} & = & \lim _{x\rightarrow 1}\frac{x^{2}+x+1}{x+1}\\
 & = & \frac{\lim _{x\rightarrow 1}x^{2}+x+1}{\lim _{x\rightarrow 1}x+1}\\
 & = & \frac{3}{2}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\item [\setenumi{26}]We use the Squeeze Theorem (see \cite[Theorem 3 in section 2.3]{Steward}).
We have that\[
\lim _{x\rightarrow 1}3x\leq \lim _{x\rightarrow 1}f(x)\leq \lim _{x\rightarrow 1}x^{3}+2\]
and therefore\[
3\leq \lim _{x\rightarrow 1}f(x)\leq 3\]
 which implies \[
\lim _{x\rightarrow 1}f(x)=3.\]

\item [\setenumi{30}]On the one hand, we have \[
\lim _{x\rightarrow 2^{-}}\frac{\left| x-2\right| }{x-2}=\lim _{x\rightarrow 2^{-}}\frac{2-x}{x-2}=-1\]
and on the other, we have \[
\lim _{x\rightarrow 2^{+}}\frac{\left| x-2\right| }{x-2}=\lim _{x\rightarrow 2^{+}}\frac{x-2}{x-2}=1.\]
Clearly, the limit doesn't exist!
