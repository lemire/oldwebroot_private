<h1>MATH 3423</h1>

<p>Daniel Lemire, Ph.D.</p>

<h2>Course Info (Winter 2002)</h2>

<p>Numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solution
of differential equations, optimization. The solution of problems
on computer forms an integral part of the course.</p>

<h2>TextBook</h2>

<p>(To Be Confirmed!!!)</p>

<p>Michael T. Heath, Scientific Computing: An Introductory
Survey, 2nd Edition (McGraw-Hill, 2001).</p>

<h2>COURSE OUTLINE</h2>

<h3>Numerical differentiation and integration (2 weeks)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Numerical Quadrature</li>

<li>Integral Equations</li>

<li>Finite Difference</li>
</ul>

<h3>optimization (4 weeks)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Steepest Descent</li>

<li>Newton's Method</li>

<li>Linear and Nonlinear Least Square Methods</li>

<li>Linear programming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading Scheme</h2>
  <table summary="grading scheme">
  <tr>
  <td>4 Assignments</td>
  <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Mid-Term Exam</td>
  <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Final Exam</td>
  <td>55%</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <p>Assignments will consist mostly of challenging
  problems to be solved using Matlab or any other
  convenient programming environment (C++ for example).
  In general, students will have two weeks to submit
  a report on the problem with plots and tables.
  Students may work in teams of up to 2 or work
  alone. In all cases, each student must write
  his own report. Students will be encouraged to
  use a word processor or similar tools (TeX, LaTeX...)
  to produce their reports.</p>
  
  <p>Exams will consist of pen and paper questions
  and while they will be similar in content 
  to the assignments, students are expected 
  to be able to prove theorems (for example).</p>

  <p>The first half of the course will be
  on Numerical integration and differential
  up to optimization problems. The Mid-Term Exam
  and the first two assignment will cover that
  material. We will then spend the rest of the
  course solving differential equations. The
  last two assignments will be on differential
  equations.</p>


<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

<li>Math 2413.</li>

<li>Strongly suggested&nbsp;: MATH 2023 or a comparable background
in Differential Equations.</li>
