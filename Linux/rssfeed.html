<h1>How to get your fresh RSS feed every morning delivered by Linux?</h1>

<pre>
First get jnews. It is free and fairly easy to setup.

You need to create a template for jnews, but that's easy (see sample file).
Mine is called <i>lemire</i>.

Then, I put the following in a script called script.sh with the following content.

cd /home/lemire/Downloads/RSS/jnews.py-1.2
/usr/bin/python2 jnews.py -i lemire -o lemire.html
/usr/bin/metasend -b -t lemireATondeletteSOMEDOTcom -s "RSS Feed" -m text/html -f lemire.html

You then run crontab -e and add the following line...

-0 1 * * *  /home/lemire/Downloads/RSS/jnews.py-1.2/script.sh /dev/null

That's it.
