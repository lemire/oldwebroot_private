<h1>How to setup a local mail server using Linux for low bandwidth settings</h1>


<p><strong>This HOWTO is now obselete. Getmail can sort mail as well as retrieve it so you don't need pycmail. Rule-based spam filtering  is also  obselete due to recent increase in spam levels.</strong></p>

<p>Except for spam filtering, you can redistribute mails to your users
on a machine from a POP server using the following .getmail/getmailrc file:</p>
<pre>
[options]
verbose = 1
read_all = 0
delete = 0
delete_after = 3

[retriever]
type = MultidropPOP3Retriever
server = mail102.csoft.net
username = someuser
password = somepass
# Our domain mailbox mailhost records the envelope recipient address in a
# new Delivered-To: header field at the top of the message.
envelope_recipient = delivered-to:1

[destination]
type = MultiSorter
default = [postmaster]
locals = (
  ("nathalie.lampron@ondelette.com",      "[milou]")
	 )
	  
[postmaster]
type = Maildir
path = ~lemire/.maildir/
user = lemire

[milou]
type = Maildir
path = ~milou/.maildir/
user = milou
</pre>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I live in a remote area in Canada somewhere. It is very difficult to
get a decent Internet connection, yet, being an IT guy, I've got big
IT needs. This page addresses some solutions I found to the <em>how 
can I check my mail fast from several machines on my internal network</em>.</p>


<p>I take the following steps... </P>

<ol>
<li>Remove spam on my POP server so I don't have to download it!</li>
<li>Retrieve my mail locally</li>
<li>Sort it among my local users</li>
<li>Serve it to my local user using a POP server</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is several times more efficient than the obvious approach which is to have all
users download mail from the provider's POP server. Moreover, because I use UIDL, the mail
isn't deleted on the server right away and so, the approach remains safe and I can check
my mail from anywhere in the world with almost no spam!!! (Because the spam is deleted
on the server.)</p>

<h2>Savemymodem</h2>


<P>Reference: <a href="http://savemymodem.sourceforge.net/">SMM Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, the very first thing you want to do is get savemymodem.
Savemymodem is a little piece of software that runs in batch mode with the -b
switch. You can easily setup a cron job to check mail using smm it every 5 minutes or so.
What it does is to monitor your account and automagically delete spam on it.
Ideally, you want to run smm *before* you actually download the mail. Savemymodem
supports UIDL which is good.</p>

<p>SMM offers a gui for configuration, but assumes you can edit files.</p>

<!-- <p>I should warn you that the UIDL implementation that Savemymodem is using is broken
because the pop3 uid command is called for every single message which is a really,
really bad idea. It can take several minutes to run whereas it should run in seconds.
Bad. There is a patch that I sent the author a long time ago, but he doesn't return
emails nor did he seem interested in fixing these problems. Sorry, but that's life.
His software is still useful, but you have to hack a bit and be very careful about
how you use it.</p>-->

<p>First, to check my mail, I set my pop3rc file under ~/.smm/plugins as this... </p>

<pre>
USEUIDLDB = YES ;
NOOPDELAY = 20 ;
POP3 = [pop.nb.sympatico.ca] 110 [someusername] [somepassword] ;
</pre>


<p>In this same directory, my inspectorrc file looks like this. This file
sets the rules to determine what is spam and what is not.</p>

<pre>

DENY [orelay] = HEAD is_in [openrelays];
DENY [oldemails] = HEAD is_in [oldemails];
ALLOW [friends] = HEAD is_in [friendserver] ;
</pre>

<p>I constantly edit it so that more and more people are on my blacklist. To run it
automatically, I've added the following like using <em>crontab -e</em></p>

<pre>0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /home/lemire/bin/mailretrieval.sh &> /dev/null</pre>

<p>Where mailretrieval.sh contains the following... </p>

<pre>
/usr/local/bin/smm -b &amp;
#
# wait two minutes or so in order not to flood the
# server
#
sleep 120
killall -9 smm
# unfortunately, smm has a tendency to spawn several threads
# and then hang mysteriously without any sensible timeout.
# It can can kill your machine so you must enforce a timeout
# of your own
sleep 30
# just for good measure, we wait another half minute
#
# second, call get mail
/usr/bin/getmail -q -m /home/lemire/.getmail/logs
</pre>

<p>This brings us to getmail!</p>

<h2>Getmail</h2>

<P>Reference: <a href="http://www.qcc.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-3.0/">Getmail Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>Getting getmail to work is as simple as creating a directory called .getmail
in your account and adding to it a file called getmailrc containing somethng like...</p>

<pre>
[default]
verbose = 1

[nbsympatico]
server = pop.nb.sympatico.ca
username = someusername
password = somepassword
postmaster = "|/usr/local/bin/pycmail"
delete = 0
delete_after = 3
readall = 0
</pre>
<p>Notice that getmail doesn't delete the mail right away (only after 3 days). I think
this is very important for safety reasons. Moreover, notice that the mail gets
routed to pycmail... What is pycmail? That's my mail delivery solution! (Well, I wrote
none of this software, so it isn't my solution per se but stay with me!)</p>

<h2>Pycmail</h2>

<P>Reference: <a href="http://melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk/~garabik/pycmail.html">SMM Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>Pycmail is another piece of great sofware. Again, the installation is simple. All
you have to do is put the pycmail where it can be found and the default pycmailrc file
to /etc/pycmailrc. Then you need to create a .pycmailrc file containing something
like:</p>

<pre>
if (InHeader("To", "nathalie@ondelette.com",case=0) or InHeader("CC","nathalie@ondelette.com",case=0) or InHeader("To","Les Petits Copains",case=0 )
or InHeader("From","tpc@qc.aira.com",case=0) or InHeader("Received", "nathalie@ondelette.com", case=0) ):
        Set(Forward("milou"))
        if(InHeader("To", "daniel") or InHeader("To","lemire") or InHeader("CC","lemire") or InHeader("CC","daniel")):
                Append(default)
                Stop()
        Stop()
</pre>

<p>In this case, I've got only two users: me and my wife (milou). Milou was given an account
on my linux box (with username milou). How do we retrieve mail from there?</p>

<h2>POP server</h2>

<p>Well, the pop server thing was really, really easy. On my redhat machine,
I had a package called imap installed and apparently, it comes with a pop server
which automagically serves mail to users who have an account on the machine.</p>

<p>Automagically? Not quite... I had to edit my /etc/xinetd.d/ipop3 file so that it
looked like this...</p>

<pre>
service pop3
{
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/sbin/ipop3d
        log_on_success  += HOST DURATION
        log_on_failure  += HOST
        disable                 = false
}
</pre>
<p>After you modify the file, you have to run <em>/sbin/service xinetd restart</em> and
then things should just work. If this seems to fail, you might have to check your
firewall (ipchains or iptables), but configuring your firewall is beyond the scope of
this text.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful. If you have questions, you can email me at mailretrieval at ondelette dot com.</p>
