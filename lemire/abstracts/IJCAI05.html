<h1>Scale-Based Monotonicity Analysis in Qualitative Modelling with Flat Segments</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Qualitative models are often more suitable than classical quantitative models in tasks such as Model-based
Diagnosis (MBD), explaining system behavior, and designing novel devices from first principles. Monotonicity is
an important feature to leverage when constructing qualitative models. Detecting monotonic pieces robustly and
efficiently from sensor or simulation data remains an open problem. This paper presents scale-based
monotonicity: the notion that monotonicity can be defined relative to a scale.  Real-valued functions defined on
a finite set of reals e.g. sensor data or simulation results, can be partitioned into quasi-monotonic segments,
i.e. segments monotonic with respect to a scale, in linear time. A novel segmentation algorithm is introduced
along with a scale-based definition of "flatness".

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>In the original version of this paper, as it appears in IJCAI'05 proceedings, we were pessimistic in the complexity analysis of the algorithm
which is O(n K): we added an extra log K factor. </p>
