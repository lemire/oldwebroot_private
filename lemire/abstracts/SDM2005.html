<h1>Slope One Predictors for Online Rating-Based Collaborative Filtering</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Rating-based collaborative filtering is the process of predicting
how a user would rate a given item from other user ratings. We
propose three related slope one schemes with predictors of the
form f(x) = x + b, which precompute the average difference
between the ratings of one item and another for users who rated
both. Slope one algorithms are easy to implement, efficient to
query, reasonably accurate, and they support both online queries
and dynamic updates, which makes them good candidates for
real-world systems. The basic slope one scheme is
suggested as a new reference scheme for collaborative filtering.
By factoring in items that a user liked separately from items that
a user disliked, we achieve results competitive with slower
memory-based schemes over the standard benchmark EachMovie and
Movielens data sets while better fulfilling the desiderata of CF
applications.
