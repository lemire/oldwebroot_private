	<title>A Better Alternative to Piecewise Linear Time Series Segmentation, SIAM Data Mining 2007, 2007. (taux de succÃ¨s de 25%) (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0605103"-->cs.DB/0605103<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Time series are  difficult to monitor, summarize and predict. Segmentation organizes time series into few intervals having uniform characteristics (flatness, linearity, modality, monotonicity and so on). For scalability, we require fast linear time algorithms. The popular piecewise linear model can determine where the data goes up or down and at what rate. Unfortunately, when the data does not follow a linear model, the computation of the local slope creates overfitting.  We propose an adaptive time series model where the polynomial degree of each interval vary (constant, linear and so on). Given a number of regressors, the cost of each interval is its polynomial degree: constant intervals cost 1 regressor, linear intervals cost 2 regressors, and so on. Our goal is to minimize the Euclidean (l_2) error for a given model complexity. Experimentally, we investigate the model where intervals can be either constant or linear. Over synthetic random walks, historical stock market prices, and electrocardiograms, the adaptive model provides a more accurate segmentation than the piecewise linear model without increasing the cross-validation error or the running time, while providing a richer vocabulary to applications. Implementation issues, such as numerical stability and real-world performance, are discussed.

	<title>Monotonicity Analysis over Chains and Curves. Compte-rendu de Curves and Surfaces 2006, pages 180-190, 2007. (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.GM/0701481"-->math.GM/0701481<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Chains are vector-valued signals sampling a curve. They are important to motion signal processing and to many scientific applications including location sensors. We propose a novel measure of smoothness for chains curves by generalizing the scalar-valued concept of monotonicity. Monotonicity can be defined by the connectedness of the inverse image of balls. This definition is coordinate-invariant and can be computed efficiently over chains. Monotone curves can be discontinuous, but continuous monotone curves are differentiable a.e. Over chains, a simple sphere-preserving filter shown to never decrease the degree of monotonicity. It outperforms moving average filters over a synthetic data set. Applications include Time Series Segmentation, chain reconstruction from unordered data points, Optical Character Recognition, and Pattern Matching.<!--/p--></description>

	<title>The LitOLAP Project: Data Warehousing with Literature, CaSTA 2006, 
        Fredericton, 2006.</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 The litOLAP project seeks to apply the Business Intelligence techniques of 
 Data Warehousing and OLAP to the domain of text processing (specifically, 
 computer-aided literary studies).  A literary data warehouse is  
 similar to a conventional corpus, but its data is stored and organized in  
 multidimensional cubes, in order to 
 promote efficient end-user queries.  An initial implementation exists for 
 litOLAP, and emphasis has been placed on cube-storage methods and caching  
 intermediate results for reuse.  Work continues on improving the 
 query engine, the ETL process, and the user interfaces.

	<title>Attribute 
 Value Reordering for Efficient Hybrid OLAP, Information Sciences, volume 176, no 16, pages 2279-2438, 2006. 
 (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0702143"-->cs.DB/0702143<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 The normalization of a data cube is the 
 ordering of the attribute values. 
 For large multidimensional arrays where dense and sparse chunks are stored 
 differently, proper normalization can lead to improved storage efficiency. 
 We show that 
 it is NP-hard to compute an optimal normalization even for 1x3 
 chunks, although we find an exact algorithm for 1x2 chunks. 
 When dimensions are nearly statistically independent, we show 
 that dimension-wise attribute 
 frequency sorting is an optimal normalization and takes time O(d n log(n)) for data 
 cubes of size n^d. 
 When dimensions are not independent, we propose and evaluate  
 several heuristics. 
 The hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) storage mechanism 
 is already 19%-30% more efficient than ROLAP, but 
 normalization can improve it further by 9%-13% 
 for a total gain of 29%-44% over ROLAP.

	<title>Analyzing 
 Large Collections of Electronic Text Using OLAP, APICS 2005, 
 Wolfville, Canada, octobre 2005. (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0605127"-->cs.DB/0605127<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has various 
     applications in the humanities and social sciences.  The 
     increasing size of many electronic text archives has the advantage 
     of a more complete analysis but the disadvantage of taking longer 
     to obtain results.  On-Line Analytical Processing is a method used 
     to store and quickly analyze multidimensional data.  By storing 
     text analysis information in an OLAP system, a user can obtain 
     solutions to inquiries in a matter of seconds as opposed to 
     minutes, hours, or even days.  This analysis is user-driven 
     allowing various users the freedom to pursue their own direction 
     of research.

	<title>An 
 Optimal Linear Time Algorithm for Quasi-Monotonic 
 Segmentation, IEEE Data Mining 2005 (ICDM-05), pp. 709-712, novembre 2005. 
 (taux de succÃ¨s de 22%) (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0702142"-->cs.DS/0702142<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Monotonicity is a simple yet significant qualitative characteristic.  We consider the problem of segmenting an array in up to K segments. We want 
 segments to be as monotonic as possible and to alternate signs. We propose a quality metric for this problem, 
 present an optimal linear time algorithm based on novel formalism, and compare experimentally its performance to a linear time top-down regression 
 algorithm. We show that our algorithm is faster and more accurate. Applications include pattern recognition and qualitative modeling.

	<title>Collaborative 
 Filtering and Inference Rules for Context-Aware Learning Object 
 Recommendation, International Journal of Interactive 
 Technology &amp; Smart Education, volume 2, no 3, aoÃ»t 
 2005.</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Learning objects strive for reusability in e-Learning to reduce cost and allow personalization of content. We argue that learning objects require 
 adapted Information Retrieval systems. 
 In the spirit of the Semantic Web, we discuss the semantic description, discovery, and composition of learning objects using Web-based MP3 objects as examples. As part of our project, we tag learning objects with both objective and subjective metadata. We study the application of collaborative filtering as prototyped in the RACOFI (Rule-Applying Collaborative Filtering) Composer system, which consists of two libraries and their associated engines: a collaborative filtering system and an inference rule system. We are currently developing RACOFI to generate context-aware recommendation lists. Context is handled by multidimensional predictions produced from a database-driven scalable collaborative filtering algorithm. Rules are then applied to the predictions to customize the recommendations according to user profiles. The prototype is available at inDiscover.net.

	<title>Quasi-monotonic 
 segmentation of state variable behavior for reactive control, 
 AAAI05, Pittsburgh, Ã‰.-U., pp. 1145-1150, juillet 2005. (taux de succÃ¨s de 
 27%)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Real-world agents must react to changing conditions as they 
 execute planned tasks. Conditions are typically monitored  
 through time series representing state variables. While some 
 predicates on these times series only consider one measure at 
 a time, other predicates, sometimes called episodic predicates, 
 consider sets of measures. We consider a special class of episodic 
 predicates based on segmentation of the the measures into quasi-monotonic intervals 
 where each interval is either quasi-increasing, quasi-decreasing, or 
 quasi-flat. While being scale-based, this approach 
 is also computational efficient and results can be computed 
 exactly without need for approximation algorithms. Our approach 
 is compared to linear spline and regression analysis.

	<title>Scale-Based 
 Monotonicity Analysis in Qualitative Modelling with Flat 
 Segments, IJCAI05, Edinburgh, G.-B.,  pp. 400--405, juillet 2005. (taux de 
 succÃ¨s de 18%)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Qualitative models are often more suitable than classical quantitative models in tasks such as Model-based 
 Diagnosis (MBD), explaining system behavior, and designing novel devices from first principles. Monotonicity is 
 an important feature to leverage when constructing qualitative models. Detecting monotonic pieces robustly and 
 efficiently from sensor or simulation data remains an open problem. This paper presents scale-based 
 monotonicity: the notion that monotonicity can be defined relative to a scale.  Real-valued functions defined on 
 a finite set of reals e.g. sensor data or simulation results, can be partitioned into quasi-monotonic segments, 
 i.e. segments monotonic with respect to a scale, in linear time. A novel segmentation algorithm is introduced 
 along with a scale-based definition of "flatness".

	<title>Slope 
 One Predictors for Online Rating-Based Collaborative 
 Filtering, SIAM Data Mining (SDM'05), pp. 471-476, 2005. (taux de succÃ¨s 
 de 36%) (<!--a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DB/0702144"-->cs.DB/0702144<!--/a-->)</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Rating-based collaborative filtering is the process of predicting 
 how a user would rate a given item from other user ratings. We 
 propose three related slope one schemes with predictors of the 
 form f(x) = x + b, which precompute the average difference 
 between the ratings of one item and another for users who rated 
 both. Slope one algorithms are easy to implement, efficient to 
 query, reasonably accurate, and they support both online queries 
 and dynamic updates, which makes them good candidates for 
 real-world systems. The basic slope one scheme is 
 suggested as a new reference scheme for collaborative filtering. 
 By factoring in items that a user liked separately from items that 
 a user disliked, we achieve results competitive with slower 
 memory-based schemes over the standard benchmark EachMovie and 
 Movielens data sets while better fulfilling the desiderata of CF 
 applications.

	<title>Scale 
 and Translation Invariant Collaborative Filtering Systems. 
 Information Retrieval, <!--b-->8<!--/b--> (1), pages 129-150, janvier 2005. 
 (CNRC 46508)</title>
	<description><!--p-->Collaborative filtering systems are prediction algorithms over sparse 
 data sets of user preferences. We modify a wide range of state-of-the-art 
 collaborative filtering systems to make them scale and translation 
 invariant and generally improve their accuracy without increasing 
 their computational cost. Using the EachMovie and the Jester data 
 sets, we show that learning-free constant time scale and translation 
 invariant schemes outperforms other learning-free constant time schemes 
 by at least 3% and perform as well as expensive memory-based schemes 
 (within 4%). Over the Jester data set, we show that a scale and translation 
 invariant Eigentaste algorithm outperforms Eigentaste 2.0 by 20%. 
 These results suggest that scale and translation invariance is a desirable 
 property.

	<title>Monotonicity 
 Analysis for Constructing Qualitative Models, dans le 
 compte-rendu de MBR'04, Pavia, Italie, 2004.</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 Qualitative models are more suitable than classical quantitative 
 models in many tasks like Model-based Diagnosis (MBD), explaining 
 system behavior, and designing novel devices from first 
 principles. Monotonicity is an important feature to leverage when 
 constructing qualitative models. Detecting monotone pieces 
 robustly and efficiently from sensor or simulation data remains an 
 open problem. This paper introduces an approach based on 
 scale-dependent monotonicity: the notion that monotonicity can be 
 defined relative to a scale. Real-valued functions defined on a 
 finite set of reals e.g. the sensor data the simulation results, 
 can be partitioned into quasi-monotone segments, i.e. segments 
 monotone with respect to nonzero scale. We can identify the 
 extrema of the quasi-monotone segments. This paper then uses this 
 method to abstract qualitative models from simulation models for 
 the purpose of diagnosis. It shows that using monotone analysis, 
 the abstracted qualitative model is not only sound, but also 
 parsimonious because it generates few landmarks.

	<title>Monotone 
 Pieces Analysis for Qualitative Modeling, dans le 
 compte-rendu de ECAI MONET 2004, Valence, Espagne, 2004.</title>
	<description><!--p--> 
 It is a crucial task to build qualitative models of industrial 
 applications for model-based diagnosis. A Model Abstraction 
 procedure is designed to automatically transform a quantitative 
 model into qualitative model. If the data is monotone, the 
 behavior can be easily abstracted using the corners of the 
 bounding rectangle. Hence, many existing model abstraction 
 approaches rely on monotonicity.  But it is not a trivial problem 
 to robustly detect monotone pieces from scattered data obtained by 
 numerical simulation or experiments. This paper introduces an 
 approach based on scale-dependent monotonicity: the notion that 
 monotonicity can be defined relative to a scale. Real-valued 
 functions defined on a finite set of reals e.g. simulation 
 results, can be partitioned into quasi-monotone segments. The end 
 points for the monotone segments are used as the initial set of 
 landmarks for qualitative model abstraction. The qualitative model 
 abstraction works as an iteratively refining process starting from 
 the initial landmarks. The monotonicity analysis presented here 
 can be used in constructing many other kinds of qualitative 
 models; it is robust and computationally efficient.
