Contributions to Science and Technology
\layout SubSection

Current work (March 2002)
\layout Standard

Daniel Lemire is currently doing research on data thinning and Computer
 Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) at Acadia University.
 He has worked for years experience in telehealth and data processing.
 He is currently interested in building efficient summaries for large XML
 files and helping data mining applications scale better on large databases
 through data thinning.
\layout Standard

Among his recent contributions to CAGD is his work on High Resolution Subdivisio
n Schemes 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-56}

\end_inset 

.
 The purpose of this work is to propose and study a new truly local data
 interpolation scheme which can be one order of magnitude better at approximatin
g polynomials than the existing schemes in some cases.
 Among applications of such work are pyramidal transforms which can be used
 for efficient progressive data transfers and analysis.
\layout SubSection

Hermite Subdivision Schemes (2000-2001)
\layout Standard

Hermite Subdivision Schemes are a CAGD and data processing technique.
 Daniel Lemire's work 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-57}

\end_inset 

 has lead to a new type of mathematical analysis for the regularity of Hermite
 Subdivision Schemes based on the Fourier transform.

Post-Doctoral Fellowships (1998-1999)
\layout Standard

Daniel Lemire got two post-doctoral fellowships: one with professor A.-R.
 LeBlanc and the other one with professor P.
 Matthieu both at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Institut de génie biomédical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (

) and at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Centre de recherche de l'Hôpital Sacré-Coeur
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (Sacré-Coeur Hospital Research Center).
 He worked on data processing applications in a medical context (ECG, NMR,
 EMG...).
\layout Standard

The following contributions were made:
\layout Itemize

A new approach to detect myocardial ischemia (lack of oxygen in one's heart)
 was proposed 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-59}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-62}

\end_inset 

.
 Myocardial ischemia is a common cause of death in North America and proper
 monitoring of the patients is important.
 The most common monitoring technique involve ECGs and a simple average
 over a small section of the heartbeat.
 We were the first to propose wavelets as a tool to measure ischemia.
 Having several perpendicular measures of the same physiological phenomenon
 typically allows one to improve accuracy.
\layout Itemize

During his post-doctoral years, Daniel Lemire contributed substantially
 to the JSci - A science API for Java project.
 Indeed, all of the processing and visualization software was written in
 Java.
 To this day, a large number of classes contributed to JSci are used in
 various Java projects through the world.

Thesis (1995-1998)
\layout Standard

Daniel Lemire got his Ph.D.
 in 1998 from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

École Polytechnique de Montréal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (largest engineering school in Canada) with professors Gilles Deslauriers
 and Serge Dubuc.
 He worked on wavelets and applications.
 His thesis was on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

iterative schemes and wavelets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 He also got his M.Sc.
 from the University of Toronto were he worked with professor Catherine
 Sulem on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

a priori estimates for nonlinear systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The following contributions were made:
\layout Itemize

New non-separable filters for image processing were proposed 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-67}

\end_inset 

.
 It is hoped that these new filters might lead to image processing algorithm
 with reduced blocking artifacts.
\layout Itemize

New boundary-aware wavelet filters were proposed 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-66}

\end_inset 

.
 This work is important for two reasons: we discovered a mathematically
 simpler approach to filter design and these new filters provide a new tool
 for engineers.
 Indeed, most wavelet filters generate (small) artifacts at the beginning
 and at the end of signals while these filters can be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

perfect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 filters with regard to the boundaries.

Contributions to Clients
\layout Standard

Since 1998, over 200,000$ in research contracts were granted by the following
 companies: THEM Geophysics Inc., FalconBridge, Waid, CIRA, Infinition, and
 Kheops.
 The 3 most significant projects are described below.
\layout SubSection

MedicalGate Association (France) 
\hfill 
 2000-2001
\layout Standard

Daniel Lemire served as a technology architect for Medical Association,
 a non-profit group of doctors, biologists and pharmacists.
 We successfully developed a medical records management system through XML
 descriptors (Multimedia Medical Format) with backward compatibility with
 systems such HPRIM.
 At the time, the proposed DTD was certainly one of the first concrete attempt
 at using XML for medical record management in France, if not the first.
 The project has since been open-sourced and is part of an ongoing attempt
 at creating an efficient XML-based medical information management system.
 
\layout Standard

It is hoped that this work will serve as a foundation for future work in
 electronic medical record processing.
\layout SubSection

Waid/CIRA/Serveur national de radiologie (France) 
\hfill 
1999-2000
\layout Standard

Daniel Lemire was the consulting scientist for the first wavelet-based image
 server for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Serveur national de radiologie
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in France (

\end_inset 

) 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-60}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-64}

\end_inset 

.
 Serving medical images (DICOM) on the web is a major undertaking since
 the average radiologist will generate over 4 gigabytes of raw data per
 day.
 In 2000, Daniel Lemire spent part of the summer at Aix-en-Provence as the
 guest scientist for this project.
 The result of this work is known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

waaves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 format and it is currently in use in France for storing and retrieving
 digital radiology images.
 It is one of the few radiology image file format using wavelets in the
 world and might have been the first.
 As far as technology is concerned, we were involved in making available
 a file format that is not normally used on the web .
\layout Standard

This work has lead to an improved encoding of radiology images and easier
 management through an embedded 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

imagette
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (thumbnail) system based on quad-tree encoding.
 
\layout SubSection

THEM Geophysics Inc./FalconBridge/CAMIRO (Canada)
\hfill 
1998-2000
\layout Standard

Over several years, Daniel Lemire worked with THEM Geophysics Inc.
 with funding from FalconBridge and CAMIRO (Canadian Mining Industry Research
 Organization) on improving geophysical data processing for the THEM system
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{key-58}

\end_inset 

.
 The THEM system is the only Canadian airborne EM system for exploring rough
 terrains.
 The signal-to-noise ratio was improved by at least 100% using better mathematic
al modeling.
 The software has been used successfully in Northern Canada and Sudan in
 exploration contracts worth several millions of dollars.
 It is impossible to estimate the exact value of such software, but geophysical
 data processing packages are typically sold for over 100,000$ for one license
 and it should be noted that no commercial solution was found to outperformed
 the software developed specifically for THEM Geophysics Inc.
